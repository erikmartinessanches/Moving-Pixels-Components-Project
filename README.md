# Moving Pixels Components Project
 Collect all the balls before all of the LEDs turn off! As you collect more balls, your body adapts by becoming faster and growing in size. Just like in sports, balls start avoiding the player. And watch out, if you leave this court, you will be teleported to the middle, losing speed and size.  Based on some provided code for displaying strings and updating the screen over SPI. I also lifted Bresenham's line algorithm but I could have showed it off better with more irregular shapes. I also used a program to translate a picture into the arrays making up the retro looking text.
